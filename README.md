# Challenge
Food recommendation systems are intended to solve the problem of information overload. With so many different foods and recipes available, it can be difficult for people to know what to eat. Food recommendation systems can help people find new and interesting foods that they might not have otherwise considered

# What the system will not solve.
Food recommendation systems will not solve all of the problems associated with food choice. For example, they cannot account for individual dietary restrictions or preferences. They also cannot guarantee that the recommended foods will be healthy or affordable.

# Who the system will help
* Food recommendation systems can help a variety of people, including:
* People who are looking for new and interesting foods to try
* People who are trying to eat healthier
* People who are on a budget
* People who are short on time

# Locale
Food recommendation systems can be relevant to a specific locale, but they do not have to be. The system can be tailored to the dietary preferences and restrictions of a particular region. For example, a food recommendation system for India would need to take into account the fact that many Indians are vegetarian.
